In this blog post I'm going to talk about how to build a Single Page Application (SPA). My SPA is about daily tasks. Every user enter her name and see the list of her daily tasks. User can create a new task, checked or unchecked tasks and delete tasks.

My frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. and it's' communicate with a backend API that I built with Ruby on Rails. 

Create Project Structure:

    mkdir Daily-Tasks
    cd Daily-Tasks
    rails new backend
    mkdir frontend

Backend (Ruby on Rails):

First I created models and their relations.

    rails g model User name --no-test-framework

    rails g model Task title image_url done:Boolean user:references --no-test-framework

Every user has_many tasks and every task belongs to a user. "user:references" in task model generator, create has_many relationship in User model, but we have to add belongs_to relation to Task model.

Then for creating restful Routes, I added the below code in routes.rb file:

    namespace :api do
        namespace :v1 do
        resources :users do
            resources :tasks
        end
        end
    end

Using api for namespacing, is a convention to show my rails application is just an API and send data and doesn't render any view. I used V1 because if I'll have any changes in my API, instead of changing my app, I'll add another version to it. 

After that I generated my Controllers:

    rails g controller users

    rails g controller tasks

According to my routes, The controllers should be in api > v1 folder. So in app > controllers I created api > v1 and move users_controller and tasks_controller to v1 folder. Also I added namespacing to controller's class definitions:

    class Api::V1::TasksController < ApplicationController

    end

For the last step in my API, I added actions in my controllers.

users_controller.rb: 

    def index 
        users = User.all
        render json: users, except: [:created_at, :updated_at]
    end

Here is the big difference between Ruby on Rails project and Rails as an API project. After getting all users, I rendered users json instead of rendering a view for showing the users.

Now with migrate, add some seeds data and run the server:

    rails server  OR  rails s

and open http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users, I should see all users as a json.
 
Now it's' time to create files, classes and functions in frontend JavaScript.

Frontend ( JavaScript ):

For frontend, I created an index.html to the root of the frontend project. At first visit, user see a form with an input text and a button. User can enter her name and click Daily Tasks button. If user doesn't exist in Database, He added to Database and recieve a message to start adding her tasks. And if user have some tasks, her tasks are loaded.

I created two foldders "Adapters" and "Components". In Adapter, For each model in backend I added a class (TasksAdapter, UsersAdapter) to send web request to backend API and receive a collection of JSON in return. For example for getting user info I created a method in UsersAdapter class:

    findOrCreateUser(userName){
        const user = {
            name: userName
        }

        return fetch(this.baseUrl, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'content-type': 'application/json',
                "Accept": "application/json"
            },
            body:  JSON.stringify( {user} )
        }).then(res => res.json())
    }

baseUrl here is "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users" and it send a web request to UsersController's create action. 

    def create
        if User.find_by(:name => user_params[:name])
            user = User.find_by(:name => user_params[:name])
            redirect_to "/api/v1/users/#{user.id}"
        else
            user = User.create(user_params)
            render json: user
        end        
    end

I used JavaScript to send a web request to backend API for create, update and delete tasks like above request and get a collection of JSON in return. Then I used that JSON to do DOM manipulation.
