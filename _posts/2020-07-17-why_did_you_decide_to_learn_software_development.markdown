When I turned 16, my father bought me a computer. I had a good time playing computer games for a while and working on Microsoft office to help my familyâ€™s business. I learned most of the problem-solving skills from this period in my life. I am a self-motivated and independent person and always want to challenge myself to complete a task without helping others. Software development is always challenging in which whenever you learn something like technology you have to be top of it. But when you reach it you will see that there are more unknown challenges.
