In this blog post, We're going to solve a Data Structure problem.

There is a string, s, of lowercase English letters that is repeated infinitely many times. Given an integer, n, find and print the number of letter a's in the first n letters of the infinite string.

For example if we have:

s = 'abc'
n = 10

The substring we consider is 'abcabcabca', the first 10 characters of the infinite string. There are 4 occurrences of a in the substring.
