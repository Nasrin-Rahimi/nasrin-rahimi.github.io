Before learning about Execution Context, we should learn about scope in JavaScript!

Scope is the concept of where something is available. In JavaScript, scope is defined by where declared variables and methods are available within our code.

Global Scope  
If a variable or function is not declared inside a function or block, it's' in the global scope.
        
Function Scope
Variables and Function declared in function, has function scope.

Block Scope
Variables and Function declared in a block by curly braces, has block scope.

Variables declared with var keyword, are not block-scoped, It means we can access to those variables outside of the block :

    if (true) {
        var myVar = 42;
    }
    myVar; // => 42

variables declared with const and let are block-scoped :

    if (true) {
        const myVar = 42;
        let myOtherVar = 9001;
    }
    
    myVar;        // Uncaught ReferenceError: myVar is not defined
    myOtherVar;   // Uncaught ReferenceError: myOtherVar is not defined
    
Variables created without a const, let, or var keyword are always globally-scoped, regardless of where they sit in your code.
        
    if (true) {
        lastName = 'Rahimi';
    }
    lastName;   // => "Rahimi"

In general, it's best practice to make variables and functions available only where they're needed â€” and nowhere else. Making a variable available in places that shouldn't have access to it, can only lead to bad things and make your debugging process more complex.
        
Inside the new function's body, in addition to variables and functions declared in that function, we also have access to variables and functions declared in the outer scope. 
    
    const globalVar = 1;
    function firstFunc () {
        const firstVar = 2;
        return firstVar + globalVar;
    } 
    firstFunc();  // => 3
    
A function has access to all variables and functions declared in its outer scope. In the other hand, All variables and functions declared in outer scopes are available in inner scopes via the scope chain. 

The scope chain only goes in one direction. An outer scope does not have access to things declared in an inner scope.
